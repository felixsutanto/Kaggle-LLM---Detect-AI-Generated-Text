# Kaggle-LLM---Detect-AI-Generated-Text

## Overview
With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, it has become increasingly challenging to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This project tackles the critical issue of identifying AI-generated essays to promote transparency and safeguard academic integrity.

This repository contains a solution for a machine learning competition aimed at determining whether an essay was written by middle/high school students or generated by an LLM.

## Description
The competition seeks to address a pressing concern: the potential misuse of LLMs in educational settings, particularly their ability to produce essays that mimic human writing. By detecting artifacts left by generative models, this project aims to contribute to the development of reliable detection techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset:** Essays written in response to seven prompts, combining student-written and LLM-generated examples.
- **Objective:** Build a classifier to predict whether an essay is human-written or LLM-generated.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) for the predicted probabilities.

This project was conducted in collaboration with **Vanderbilt University**, **The Learning Agency Lab**, and Kaggle, with support from organizations such as the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, **Schmidt Futures**, and **Chan Zuckerberg Initiative**.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes the following:
- **Notebook:** [`llm-detect-ai-generated-text.ipynb`](./llm-detect-ai-generated-text.ipynb) - Code for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The dataset used for this project is hosted on Kaggle and can be accessed here:  
[LLM - Detect AI Generated Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detect-ai-generated-text/).

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the **AUC-ROC** score:
- **Public Score:** 0.734343  
- **Private Score:** 0.630729  

A successful submission should predict the probability of an essay being generated (`1` for AI, `0` for human) for each essay in the test set.
