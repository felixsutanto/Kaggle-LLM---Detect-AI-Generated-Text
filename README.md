# 🧠 Detect AI-Generated Text (Kaggle Competition)

This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle competition: LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/), where the task is to determine whether an essay was written by a human or generated by a large language model (LLM).

## 🏁 Competition Summary

- **Goal**: Identify AI-generated essays from human-written ones.
- **Use case**: Crucial for academic integrity, content authenticity, and AI transparency.

## 🏆 My Results

- ✅ **Private Score**: `0.646579`

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `llm-detect-ai-generated-text.ipynb`:  
  The main notebook that includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

- `llm-detect-ai-generated-text-submission.ipynb`:  
  A clean version of the notebook used to generate the final predictions for submission.

## 🔍 Approach Overview

### 🔧 Preprocessing
- Cleaned the essay text (removing extra whitespace, standardizing characters, etc.).
- Applied basic NLP normalization steps.

### 🧮 Feature Engineering
- TF-IDF vectorization on word-level and character-level n-grams.
- Engineered features based on:
  - Essay length
  - Number of punctuation marks
  - Readability scores

### 🤖 Modeling
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier on the extracted features.
- Performed validation using a stratified train/validation split to maintain label balance.

### 📤 Submission
- Final model predictions were formatted to match the Kaggle submission requirements and uploaded for scoring.

## 📦 Requirements

To reproduce the results, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
````

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `llm-detect-ai-generated-text.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to train the model and evaluate performance.
4. To generate submission file, open and run `llm-detect-ai-generated-text-submission.ipynb`.
